# PropertyPlotMap
The prototype will focus on:  Displaying a map centered on Pimpri-Chinchwad. Loading a small set of simulated property data (as real-time data integration is beyond a quick prototype). Placing interactive markers on the map for each property. Showing basic property details in an info window when a marker is clicked. 


PropertyPlotMap: Working Prototype Blueprint (MVP)
This prototype will use a very simplified tech stack to get something visual working quickly.

Core Technologies for Prototype:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Mapping API: Google Maps JavaScript API
Data: A static JSON file (simulating a backend API response)
Local Server: A simple Python HTTP server (or similar for other languages) to serve the static files.
